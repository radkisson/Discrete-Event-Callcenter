# Discrete-Callcenter

- Call-center discrete event simulation project mostly done using numpy and simple data structures.
- Variable names are in euskera, I know, it's hard to read.
- Simulated ussing both Poisson and Exponential distributions

## Installation

Install the required dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the simulation and write the results file:

```bash
python main.py --simulate
```

Generate statistics from an existing `results.txt` file:

```bash
python main.py --stats
```
